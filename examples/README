This is the 'standard' hello world example in the ZeroMQ docs.

An example of how to compile and run is as follows.
run this for each individual file.
dmd -I(Path to zmq.d) [hwclient.d|hwserver.d] -L-L(Path to Libs) -L-lzmq

Assuming Linux here:
run the example with ./hwserver&; ./hwclient;

You will need to manually stop hwserver.
killall hwserver
