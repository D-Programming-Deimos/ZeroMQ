"ZeroMQ in a hundred words"
"ØMQ (ZeroMQ, 0MQ, zmq) looks like an embeddable networking library but acts like a 
concurrency framework. It gives you sockets that carry whole messages across various 
transports like in-process, inter-process, TCP, and multicast. You can connect sockets 
N-to-N with patterns like fanout, pub-sub, task distribution, and request-reply. It's 
fast enough to be the fabric for clustered products. Its asynchronous I/O model gives you 
scalable multicore applications, built as asynchronous message-processing tasks. It 
has a score of language APIs and runs on most operating systems. ØMQ is from iMatix 
and is LGPL open source."

Usage can be derived by translating the guide above using the interface(s)
here. Alternatively some wrapper implementations are listed below.

Usage:
	import deimos.zmq.zmq;
	link your program with zmq, and Zap, Pow! (to quote the site) it works.
